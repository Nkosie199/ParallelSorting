Good day!

To run this program please be advised that the main method is within the DriverSort class and enter command line parameters in the form of:

<sortType> <minArraySize> <maxArraySize> <increment> <outputFile>

Example terminal command: java DriverSort mergesort 100 1000 50 outFile

Please note that the sortType variable must be entered in lower caps and in order to change the sequential cutoff you must enter your desired cutoff values manually within the 'seqCut' array specified in the DriverSort.java class. It is probably set to some arbitrary value right now.

Kind Regards
